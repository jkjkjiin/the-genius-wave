brain can hold three million hours of TV shows, but if that's true, why don't you feel like a genius? The root of our problems comes down to one brainwave. You have this brainwave. It's dormant.\n\nAll it takes is a seven second ritual at home to activate the brainwave. Think you know what it I'd be surprised if you did. This brainwave is linked to genius abilities. Great ideas just come to you.\n\nYou learn faster Lucky things happen. NASA studied this brain wave, but we've all been ignoring it. So we're gonna activate this brain wave now because it not on YouTube or Google or any books on Amazon. My name is doctor James Rivers.\n\nThe breakthrough exploded when a colleague handed me a forgotten study by NASA, and stay with me. This gets good. NASA wanted to measure the brain power of future rocket scientists, so they studied a set of kids and what they found shocked them. Ninety eight percent of the kids scored at creative genius levels, the little devils.\n\nNearly every kid had a creative ability to solve even the most difficult problems. You had that same power when you were a young kid too, by the way. Five years later, NASA administers the same test to the same kids, except this time, only thirty percent of the children scored at creative genius. And by the time the kids were teenagers only twelve percent.\n\nBut what about us adults? How many of us still have access to our god given creative genius, which could allow us to transform our finances, our health, our relationships right now. Brace yourself for this one. Given the same tests, less than two percent of adults still had access to this super brain power.\n\nThat means as kids, ninety eight percent us had this super brain. But as adults, only two percent of us. As a scientist, I had to know what robbed us of this genius power that was once yours. People might tell you the school system, and there's truth to that.\n\nBut it dawned on me. If I could discover what's really going on at this cellular level, then maybe we could reactivate that brainpower in you. And I have good news. It turns out that we can because this brainpower isn't about remembering facts from a textbook.\n\nIt taps into your intuition. You have eureka moments. Difficult problems get solved with a great insight. And I know it's not a scientific term, but it's almost as if you become lucky.\n\nAnd things just start working out more and more for you in your life. As a neuroscientist for thirty four years, the magic of the human mind never stops surprising me. But what I found pouring through the research stunned even me, you know how people say we only use ten percent of our brain? Well, it's not accurate.\n\nIt, but there's a seed of truth. It turns out if you look at a child's consciousness with an EEG machine, you can see their brain waves. And what you see is kids have a very active theta wave. But when you look at an adult's consciousness, you see almost no theta wave.\n\nIt's like it's been deactivated. And neuroscientists who have gone beyond the classroom know that people at the theta level tend to report many lucky things happening to them. Remarkable events, transformations take place at theta. Problems get solved.\n\nGenius happen You might call it magic or good luck, but it's something different. It's almost like people who tap into theta can shape reality, and the universe has your back. It's because when you're at the fatal level, several regions of your brain activate at the same time and connect to each other. It's like having a super brain Let me explain.\n\nThis theta discovery is the root of all our problem. Recently colleagues in Japan found the famous flow state was linked to theta in an unbreakable chain. All athletes and musicians seek to be in the flow state. And so should you?\n\nBecause the flow state is when you're in the zone and everything becomes easier for you. When Tom Brady throws a game winning touchdown, he's in a flow state with Theda. When Taylor Swift is performing for seventy thousand people, she's in flow state with theta, but you'd be amazed to discover it's not new. You can go back a century and still see leaders seeking theta.\n\nThomas Edison invented a complicated contract that activated Theta for him. He wrote that this device solved his hardest problems for him. Have you ever wondered why so many billionaires say they wake up at exactly four AM and not at a different hour? Well, these billionaires know how their brain works.\n\nThey're taking advantage of the theta brainwave. Is elevated when you wake up at that time. It makes deep and profound learning very easy, where you don't have to work nearly as hard. The fade away is so transformative that in the lab, my colleagues and I refer to it as the genius wave.\n\nThere's even research from Columbia University showing your theta could influence another person. This could mean that if you have more theta, you could bless your kids with it and pass it down to them. I want you to understand. This is the root cause of our problems and bad luck.\n\nWe are born with miraculous human ability, but from the time we are born, the modern way of life systematically suppresses this genius way. Rendering it mostly deactivated. Our powers and destiny have been stolen from us at the neural level. Although my critics laugh when I say it, this is truly the great swindle of our lifetime This is why it takes you so long to learn a new skill that could improve your finances, while a few lucky people can pick it up with ease.\n\nIt's why you think of what you should have said after the conversation. It's why love and relationships go sour. It's why great insights and eureka moments come to others, but rarely to you. The deck stacked against us, causing the god given brainwave that could transform your life and luck to shrink and shrink and shrink before you even had a chance as an and the longer this goes on, the more frustrated you'll feel.\n\nThis is why so many people become bitter and resentful as they get older. They're missing out on god gift to them. But they can turn it all around starting as soon as today. And so can you?\n\nHere are the four ways we know for a fact that will activate your Theta wave. Number one, meditation. If you can meditate twice a day for twenty minutes a day, you'll begin to activate your theta wave. This one is not a great option for a lot of folks because it's very hard and time consuming.\n\nNumber two, wake up at four AM. This is what many billionaires do, but it's also very hard and tiring. I don't even do this myself. Number three, use a bio feedback machine.\n\nBio feedback machinery has been shown to activate your genius wave, but in person sessions start at around three hundred dollars per hour, And an in home bio feedback machine will set you back about seven thousand dollars. Number four, you can use a special sound wave. This is the easiest way by far, and I had the ideal sound wave for you, but let me tell you why. When my colleagues and I began researching how to activate the genius wave, We wanted something that was simple, easy, and that you could do at home.\n\nAnd we knew the solution would be unique because this hasn't existed until now. And there were thousands of studies, not to mention ancient texts that have been around for centuries to go through. So let me give you a clue. Nicola Tesla advised if you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of frequency and vibration.\n\nHe was a bit out there, but he was right. We realized sound waves were a perfect solution because sound is all about vibrations. And our sound wave used brain entrainment, which works by guiding the brain into theta. But there's a problem.\n\nBrain entrainment normally takes one hour per session. But after many late nights and coffee runs at the lab, my PhDs were able to turn one hour of brain entrainment into a seven minute sound wave. You'll love what happened next. Being researchers, we tested it on ourselves first.\n\nWe wondered, would it work like the research showed, or did we forget something? We listened to the sound wave every day for seven minutes, making sure not to miss a day. After a few short weeks, we knew it was working. When one colleague reported he'd finished his book, which had been sitting incomplete on his computer for three years.\n\nHe said the book just suddenly came together for him, but there's more. Another colleague reported his persistent migraine ethics had just disappeared after a week of listening. His son's test results had gone from a c to an a at school. It was transforming his entire family.\n\nAnd it didn't stop there. After three weeks of listening, a female colleague who had been divorced and single for several years accidentally bumped carts with a man at Trader Joe's. That man is now her fiance. It all felt a bit magical.\n\nAnother colleague reported losing sixteen pounds from his belly. And after eleven years of cigarettes, another reported he lost the urge to smoke and quit. His behavior towards smoking had been reprogrammed.\n\nAnd it wasn't just him. His wife had been listening to the sound wave every day too, and she'd gotten the promotion at work. She swore she'd be passed over for. Which included a signing bonus.\n\nWe called this seven minute sound wave, the genius wave, and turned it into a digital audio track anyone could listen to right now. So far, it's helped eighteen thousand three hundred sixty six everyday Americans start to live a lucky and blessed life. The Genius wave is the first sound wave developed by neuroscience test that uses advanced brain entrainment to activate theta, and the mind power that can transform your life. It's simple, easy, and you can do it at Just pop on a pair of headphones and relax for seven minutes listening to the calming sound wave.\n\nBeneath your awareness, the advanced brain entrainment will begin activating your theta by in several regions of your brain to each other. It starts working the very first time you listen to it. You'll do it from the privacy of your own home. And you don't need to meditate, repeat a mantra, or write anything down.\n\nYou just listen to the sound wave for seven minutes every day as it synchronizes with your brain waves and activates your theta. The result is an activated genius wave, reconnecting you with the brain power that's currently dormant in you. You'll notice insights and eureka moments begin to flow to difficult problems will become solved with little to no effort on your part. As you listen more each day, things shift and new abilities begin to unlock.\n\nYou'll automatically start thinking bigger about your life. And you'll notice a sense of easy confidence in your quest for amazing health, amazing relationships, amazing career. And did you know deep learning happens in theta? So you'll find it easier to remember key ideas or learn a new skill, like a musical instrument, or even a new money making skill.\n\nBest of all, operating at the theta level is the key to things falling into place for you and your family. Synchrony cities happen. Abundance happen. Opportunities come your way.\n\nGive it a few weeks and you might find your behavior towards food or exercise or even giving up smoking has changed, and you feel in control. Since it's release, the genius wave has helped thousands of people around the world experience a transformation in their life. People like Rachel, a nurse from Tustin, California, who wrote me and said before I started using this product, I felt I was at the mercy of events. Bad things would happen, and I had no control.\n\nOver time, I'd accepted this as my fate, even when something good would happen, like when my daughter got engaged, it was a sinking feeling because I felt the universe would balance out the good and send me something bad. Over the years, I tried meditation, yoga, and even the law of attraction stuff, but nothing seemed to truly impact my life. Within two weeks of listening to the genius wave, this product has made me a new woman, a much kinder to my kids and husband, and I'm learning to speak French. It's actually easy now.\n\nIt's hard to describe. My life feels enchanted now. Like, I'm the center of some wonderful little fairy tale. While I would never be able to afford to fly to Doctor.\n\nRivers and see him in person, I can't thank him and his colleagues enough for making this available to people who need it. Five stars. Here's another one. Wanted to try this for the financial aspect.\n\nI'd hope tapping into theta would unlock that genius creative ability we all had as young kids and help me grow my Amazon business. I also hope my six year old and eight year old would take an interest in bettering their mind too when they saw me do it. I didn't notice much the first week. But in week two, my wife commented that I'd seemed sharper.\n\nShe joked you were always smart, but it seems like your IQ has gone up twenty points. It's been a couple months now, and my Amazon business is doing well enough that I quit my nine to five. When problems arise, I don't get worried about. I just know theta will figure it out for me.\n\nAnd within a couple days, solution just comes to me. I told my friends it's my new superpower. My kids love listening to this product before bed. The best benefit of all might be they don't fight us on bedtime anymore.\n\nI hope this helps someone who wants to improve their finances like I did. I love this product. That's from Michael in Dallas. Hannah from Manhattan said, since I was a kid, my family has been superstitious.\n\nEveryone says we have bad luck. A few years ago, my mom was sick and the doctor told my mom, she needed to have her leg amputated to save her life. So she had the surgery. And then we found out after she didn't need to have her leg amputated.\n\nThings like that. So I was excited when doctor Rivers talked about what happens when we're at the theta level more often. And this sound wave has changed everything for me. My relationship with my husband has transformed, and in a team meeting, an idea struck me out of nowhere that's grown our entire company.\n\nA little after that, I got promoted. My family's so called curse is no more. I can't believe how different I feel now. I feel like everyone should know about this product.\n\nI've recommended it to all my friends and family I received hundreds of emails like this, and it inspires me to spread the word of the genius wave to as many people as possible. The genius wave is much faster than a meditation practice. And much more affordable than a seven thousand dollar bio feedback machine. And because several regions of your brain activate at the same time, transformations in people's finances, health, relationships, and career are not uncommon.\n\nIt's time for you to experience life with the brainpower nature had in mind for you. Before our modern way of life deactivated, Just imagine waking up each morning refreshed with solutions to problems handed to you and real clarity about how to get the outcome you want. Imagine grasping a new idea the first time you hear it even though it takes others days or weeks to get it, imagine reconnecting with your mind's intuitive power where great insights and creativity flow to you as you need them. Imagine the look on a friend's face as you handle a difficult conversation with ease because the right word now comes to you.\n\nYou suddenly have access to the insights that make your career take off, or you learn a new money making skill quickly and improve your finances. Maybe you stun your family by learning a new language or musical and it's actually fun. Great opportunities are abundant. Things start to go your way, and life gets better and better for you and your family.\n\nThat's the life you deserve, and you can have it all today when you claim your copy of the genius way. By now, you should realize that I take great pride in the that I do as one of America's most diligent neuroscientists.\n\nMy reputation is everything, and I would only ever attach my name to a product if I one hundred percent believe in Bottom line is a lot of time and money goes into this research. However, when you compare the time that genius wave takes to the months of time that even basic meditation requires, or when you compare the price to the expensive equipment out there that promises to do the same thing, it will seem like a bargain. And given the transformation that activating your Theta wave could have on your life, We could easily offer this at a very high price. Think about it.\n\nHow much would you be willing to invest to have difficult problems solved for you with a great insight? Much would you pay to land a promotion, or get a raise? What about having your behavior towards food, or exercise, or smoking repro ramp for you or watching your relationship with your partner or your kids transform. What would it be worth to not just feel like the universe has your back, but to actually see it guide and support you each day, think about the power and control you're going to feel.\n\nWhat would you be willing to spend for this kind of transformation? Two hundred, three hundred, five hundred. How much does it cost you in your lifetime struggling to get what you want? Because remember what Columbia University has found.\n\nThe fader region of your brain can influence another. That means by activating it, you could support your kids or your partner with it too. But if you don't, That means they miss out on the benefits too. You really can't put a price on being tapped into your mind's intuitive ability and having the things that you want happen for you.\n\nMany of my colleagues have suggested that this product would be an incredible value even at five hundred dollars. However, because my main goal with this product was to help all of the people who couldn't afford to come see me at my New York City clinic. We cut out all middlemen and made it available only through this website. That means you don't need to invest five hundred dollars to get your hands on this breakthrough sound wave.\n\nIn fact, you don't need to invest two hundred dollars or even one hundred dollars. That's because we are offering the genius wave today for just forty nine dollars. That's more than forty percent off our original price, but that's not all. Because you've made it this far into the presentation, it's obvious you're serious about experiencing a breakthrough in your life.\n\nAnd you are interested in seeing how this one of a kind solution can help you same way it's helping thousands of others, which is why I want to let you try this cutting edge sound wave at a special price available only through this video on this page today.

The last thing I want is for you to come back later and see higher prices or worse, find out genius wave is no longer available for purchase.

So I'm just going to answer a few of the most common questions while you're sitting there deciding to claim your own copy.\n\nThe first question is from Sophia in Lakeway who asks, what makes the genius wave superior to meditation or biofeedback. Meditation has exploded in popularity over the last decade. So why has depression and stress disorders continue to get worse over the same period? Over fifteen thousand studies show meditation has benefits.\n\nI meditate sometimes because I find it enjoyable, but it takes months to see the benefits. And that's if you can be consistent with your meditation practice of twenty to forty minutes a day every day, which most people can't. And what about biofeedback? Bio feedback can be effective for activating the genius wave, but in person sessions start at around three hundred dollars per hour.\n\nAnd an in home bio feedback machine costs seven thousand dollars. The genius wave costs one hundred eighty times less than that. And the genius wave works much faster than a meditation practice. It only takes seven minutes a day.\n\nEveryone can find seven minutes a day to pop on a pair of headphones and relax for seven minutes listening to the special sound wave as it synchronizes with your brain waves and activates your theta. And the benefits go way beyond meditation because we're targeting theta. Transformationations in people's finances, health, relationships, and career are not uncommon. It begins working the very first time you listen to it, reconnecting you with the brainpower that's currently dormant.\n\nOlivia from Tampa asks How exactly do I use the genius wave? Great question. Listening to the genius wave is simple, easy, and you can do it at home as soon as today. Just download the digital audio track to your phone or computer.\n\nAll the technology is already programmed onto the track and will begin activating your theta by connecting several regions of your brain to each other below your awareness. So there's nothing you have to do. Just close your eyes and listen. After seven minutes, the audio track will finish and you'll be done.\n\nThat's it. You don't need to meditate, repeat a mantra, or write anything down. And what if you miss a day? It's okay, and it's not the end of the world if you do.\n\nJust aim to listen every day for those seven minutes. The benefits increase every time you listen, and the result is an activated genius wave and all the remarkable benefits that come with The next email comes from Ray and Victoria. He says how fast will I see results? Everybody is different.\n\nAnd it really depends on how deactivated your theta was by your upbringing and society. Overall, many of our customers start to notice a difference, like clarity about what they should do, the insight they want most coming to them or even problems that somehow solve themselves within the first two to three days. Some people even say they get a life changing eureka moment just a few hours after listening for the first time. Other changes like improved finances or weight loss may happen over time in the coming weeks and months.\n\nRemember, your mind is the power source that influences every part of your life.

Next question is from Amy in Las Vegas. Will the genius wave help me at the casino? This is a fun question.\n\nThe truth is I wish Although a few customers have reported some amazing stories of their luck changing while playing the slots or roulette or even betting on a sport, there is, of course, no evidence to support that the genius wave caused that. Next question is from Damon in Raleigh who asked, will it help me with my finances or career? What about my studies? How important do you think your brain power is for your career?\n\nThink about it. How do you rise up the ladder in your career? How do you land the promotion or sign the client or secure that pay raise? You do it by providing more value with great insights that no one else does.\n\nBy being able to spot trends and see things in ways others can't and capitalizing on those opportunities. And there's always a bit of luck involved. People call it right place, right time, but it's not out of our control. What they're talking about is your intuition.\n\nThe great guide inside of all of us who can see around corners and help us get what we want. We are all born with this miraculous human ability, but from the time we are born, the modern way of life systematically suppresses this in us. Rendering it mostly untapped and deactivated at the neural level. And if you're a student, remember the deepest learning happens in theta.\n\nSo you'll find it easier to remember key ideas or learn a new project faster. You'll find it simple to grasp a new idea the first time you hear it, like it just gels with you, even though it takes others days or even weeks to get it.

Right? Wrong. That's not true for everyone, and it might not need to be true for you either.\n\nYour body's natural healing properties are a marvel, but your body can't heal effectively in a stressful environment. If your body is always in fight or flight mode from everyday stress, healing is slowed or never even happens completely. That's how you end up with aches and joint pains that never seem to go away. And so much of our disease and inflammation comes from our mind, which is causing the stress.\n\nDid you know a single thought can release acid in your stomach? Activating your genius wave is an incredible way to reduce stress naturally and accelerate healing, so those joint pains can start to go away. And if you're finding it impossible to curb your cravings or quit smoking, this can be a big help. Something about operating more in theta causes things to shift and new abilities to unlock.\n\nMany customers have reported their behavior towards bad food or smoking, has been reprogrammed, and they're not relying on willpower. They say they just don't want it anymore. That's why so many people who purchase the genius wave come to it with different needs and get the result they're looking for because everything starts with the power of your mind. Liz from Frankford emails and says, should I do the genius wave with other things too, like yoga and meditation?\n\nSure you can, but do them because you enjoy them. Not because you expect them to activate your theta to any meaningful degree. Personally, I meditate sometimes because I find it enjoyable. I wouldn't do it otherwise because I don't need to anymore.\n\nJust listen to the genius wave seven minutes every day as it synchronizes with my brain waves and activates my theta more and more.

Russell from Atlanta asks, is the genius wave available anywhere else for a lower price?\n\nCan I find the audio soundtracks on YouTube or Spotify? We only offer the genius wave direct through this website for a very important reason. I was approached by a large publisher to offer the genius wave through them. If I did that, the markup they required would make the price at least double what it is now for our customers.\n\nAll that extra markup makes no sense. It's just added to subsidize all of their overhead and advertising costs, as well as put extra profit in their pockets, which would be pointless since you can already order the genius wave from the comfort of your home directly from this website. I was also concerned they might water down the technology we developed and placed in the genius wave audio. Which cannot be found anywhere else, including on YouTube or Spotify.\n\nIn fact, we studied the tracks offered on those websites and the results were disappointing. For many of them, there was no brain entrainment technology embedded in the audio sounds at all. They just tell you that to get clicks and ad revenue. Also, please keep in mind the price is set to increase well, but I'm still fighting to keep it affordable for the people who need it most.\n\nSo this thirty nine dollar price is not guaranteed beyond today. The last thing I want is for you to come back later and see higher prices or worse, find out genius wave is no longer available for purchase.
